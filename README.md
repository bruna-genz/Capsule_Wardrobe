## About the app
Capsule Wardrobe is a virtual catalog where users can upload clothes pictures, classify them in lists, and create personalized looks.

I created this project to join two of my interests: improving my Rails skills and having a more sustainable wardrobe. With the concept of Capsule Wardrobe in mind, I planned and designed an application that would help me in the process of building my own capsule wardrobe, taking into consideration my needs to create the app's features, such as adding personalized categories and the ability to create looks for future reference. During the creation of the app, I had to find solutions for some problems, such as finding an affordable way to store the images permanently.

## About Capsule Wardrobe
### What is capsule wardrobe?
Capsule wardrobe it's a collection of a few essential and versatile clothes that don't go out of fashion. They can be mixed and matched to create a wide variety of outfits for everyday use. They can be mixed and matched to create a wide outfits variety for everyday use.

### Why does it matter?
- Because it helps us protect the environment. The fashion industry is the second-largest polluter in the world, just after the oil industry.
- Because it saves money. Buying fewer clothes means you will have more money for things that matters more for you. 
- Because it saves time. A capsule wardrobe is practical and functional, reflecting your lifestyles and taste, so you won't stay anymore in front of the closet thinking on what to wear.
